Thus, propolis may play a role as a therapeutic agent.[^1]\n\n### Gynecological Disorders\n\nPropolis may be used for Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVVC) and can be an alternative option for patients who are unable to take antibiotics due to a concurrent pharmacological treatment. The effectiveness of propolis against conventional antifungal nystatin has shown satisfactory results. Propolis extract solution (PES) also show low toxicity in human cells and can be an alternative treatment for chronic vaginitis.[^1]\n\n#### Vaginitis \n\n#### Bacterial vaginosis (BV)\n\n#### Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)\n\nPES has antifungal properties and it can be used as antibiofilm material for Recurrent VVC to counteract biofilm growth of C. albicans and resistance in antifungal drug.[^1]\n\n### Gastrointestinal Disorders\n\n#### Gastric ulceration\n\nAntihistaminergic, antiinflammatory, antiacid, and anti-H. pylori activities can be used to help treat gastric ulceration.[^1]\n\n#### Parasites\n\nPropolis ethanolic extract was shown to inhibit growth and adherence of Giardia duodenalis trophozoites.[^1]\n\nIt also promotes the detachment of these parasitic organisms.[^1]\n\nThe efficacy of Propolis extract against giardiasis has been reported in a clinical study whereby children and adults with giardiasis-given propolis showed a cure rate between 52% and 60%, whereas those given the conventional drug showed a 40% cure rate.[^1]\n\n[^1]: **Title:** [Honey, Propolis, and Royal Jelly: A Comprehensive Review of Their Biological Actions and Health Benefits](https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/1259510)<br>\n**Publication:** [Hindawi: Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/)<br>\n**Date:** July 26, 2017<br>\n**Study Type:** Comprehensive Review<br>\n**Author(s):** Visweswara Rao Pasupuleti, Lakhsmi Sammugam, Nagesvari Ramesh, and Siew Hua Gan<br>\n**Institution(s):** Universiti Malaysia Kelantan, Campus Jeli, Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia<br>\n**Copy:** [archive](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQne8ghnCDZ6X1NWR6n84bX8R37DNuB5TFLsWjrPwk1S4), [archive-mirror](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmQne8ghnCDZ6X1NWR6n84bX8R37DNuB5TFLsWjrPwk1S4)\n\n[^2]: **Title:** [Antibacterial activity of propolis against Streptococcus mutans ](https://www.medigraphic.com/pdfs/revcubest/esc-2020/esc201i.pdf)<br>\n**Publication:** [Revista Cubana de Estomatología](https://www.medigraphic.com/cgi-bin/new/publicacionesI.cgi?IDREVISTA=248)<br>\n**Date:** 2020<br>\n**Study Type:** Bacterial Study: In Vitro<br>\n**Author(s):** César Félix Cayo Rojas, Luis Adolfo Cervantes Ganoza<br>\n**Institution(s):** Universidad Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Lima, Perú; Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Perú<br>\n**Copy:** [archive](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYeWNyaMWqnoHBnLFfLdL2XtAErsstAZ9hpQyfxhkZN2p), [archive-mirror](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmYeWNyaMWqnoHBnLFfLdL2XtAErsstAZ9hpQyfxhkZN2p)\n\n[^3]: **Title:** []()<br>\n**Publication:** []()<br>\n**Date:** <br>\n**Study Type:** Animal Study, Commentary, Human Study: In Vitro - In Vivo - In Silico, Human: Case Report, Meta Analysis, Review<br>\n**Author(s):** <br>\n**Institution(s):** <br>\n**Copy:** [archive](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/), [archive-mirror](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/)","slug":"Bee Products/bee-propolis","published":1,"date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2023-05-26T18:57:14.689Z","_id":"cli4xfya90001h4iw4des2bp4","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p><strong>Bee Propolis</strong> is the resinous substance accumulated by bees from different types of plants.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Propolis functions in sealing holes and cracks and for the reconstruction of the beehive.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1:1\">[1:1]</a></sup> It is also used for smoothing the inner surface of the beehive, retaining the hive’s internal temperature (35° C), preventing weathering and invasion by predators.

Mānuka honey is produced by European honey bees (Apis mellifera) foraging on the mānuka tree (Leptospermum scoparium) which grows uncultivated throughout New Zealand and southeastern Australia.[^1]\n\n## Healing Properties\n\n### Antiinflammatory\n\n### Antiviral\n\n### Antimicrobial\n\nManuka honey contains a methylglyoxal component which imbues it with additional antimicrobial activity compared to other varieties of honey.[^1]\n\n- The methylglyoxal component of manuka honey is primarily responsible for the Unique Manuka Factor (UMF), a term used by the industry to describe the heightened antimicrobial activity of Manuka honey.[^1]\n\n### Antibacterial\n\nAfter Manuka honey is collected, it is subject to a bacterial inhibition test, and the UMF is defined as the concentration of phenol necessary to achieve the bacterial inhibition of that Manuka honey sample (for instance, Manuka honey with a UMF of 15 would exhibit the same bacterial inhibition as 15% phenol).[^1]\n\n### Epithelialization (Wound Healing)\n\nManuka honey significantly reduces neutrophil (white blood cell) recruitment and inflammatory behavior in the wound site in a dose-dependent fashion under the cytotoxic limit.[^1]\n\n## Disease / Symptom Treatment\n\n### Cancer\n\n#### Chemotherapy\n\nCombination treatment of cancer cells with manuka honey and chemotherapy demonstrated an improvement in host survival. This highlights a potentially novel role for manuka honey in alleviating chemotherapy-induced toxicity.[^2]\n\n### Burn Treatment\n\n[^1]: **Study Type:** Human Study: In Vitro<br>**Title:** Manuka Honey Modulates the Inflammatory Behavior of a dHL-60 Neutrophil Model under the Cytotoxic Limit<br>**Author(s):** Benjamin A.

However, little research has been done examining its effect on neutrophils. This study investigates the hypothesis that Manuka honey reduces neutrophil superoxide release and chemotaxis and reduces the activation of the inflammatory nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway under honey’s cytotoxic limit. A differentiated HL-60 cell line was used as a neutrophil model and cultured in various concentrations of Manuka honey for 3 and 24 hours to measure cytotoxicity via mitochondrial activity and visual trypan-exclusion count. Cytochrome C and Boyden chamber assays were used to measure the effect of Manuka honey on superoxide release and chemotaxis toward fMLP, respectively. Additionally, a Western blot for NF-κB inhibitor α (IκBα) was performed to measure Manuka honey’s effect on the NF-κB pathway via IκBα phosphorylation. The results indicate a cytotoxic limit of 3-5% v/v. The presence of 1% honey decreased superoxide release at 24 hours. The 0.5, 1, and 3% honey concentrations reduced chemotaxis and IκBα phosphorylation in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that Manuka honey significantly reduces neutrophil recruitment and inflammatory behavior in the wound site in a dose-dependent fashion under the cytotoxic limit.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/6132581)<br>**Citations:** \n\n[^2]: **Study Type:** Animal Study: In Vitro<br>**Title:** Intravenous Administration of Manuka Honey Inhibits Tumor Growth and Improves Host Survival When Used in Combination with Chemotherapy in a Melanoma Mouse Model<br>**Author(s):** Maria J.

In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative activity of manuka honey on three different cancer cell lines, murine melanoma (B16.F1) and colorectal carcinoma (CT26) as well as human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells in vitro. The data demonstrate that manuka honey has potent anti-proliferative effect on all three cancer cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner, being effective at concentrations as low as 0.6% (w/v). This effect is mediated via the activation of a caspase 9-dependent apoptotic pathway, leading to the induction of caspase 3, reduced Bcl-2 expression, DNA fragmentation and cell death. Combination treatment of cancer cells with manuka and paclitaxel in vitro, however, revealed no evidence of a synergistic action on cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we utilized an in vivo syngeneic mouse melanoma model to assess the potential effect of intravenously-administered manuka honey, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, on the growth of established tumors.

In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative activity of manuka honey on three different cancer cell lines, murine melanoma (B16.F1) and colorectal carcinoma (CT26) as well as human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells in vitro. The data demonstrate that manuka honey has potent anti-proliferative effect on all three cancer cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner, being effective at concentrations as low as 0.6% (w/v). This effect is mediated via the activation of a caspase 9-dependent apoptotic pathway, leading to the induction of caspase 3, reduced Bcl-2 expression, DNA fragmentation and cell death.

However, little research has been done examining its effect on neutrophils. This study investigates the hypothesis that Manuka honey reduces neutrophil superoxide release and chemotaxis and reduces the activation of the inflammatory nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway under honey’s cytotoxic limit. A differentiated HL-60 cell line was used as a neutrophil model and cultured in various concentrations of Manuka honey for 3 and 24 hours to measure cytotoxicity via mitochondrial activity and visual trypan-exclusion count. Cytochrome C and Boyden chamber assays were used to measure the effect of Manuka honey on superoxide release and chemotaxis toward fMLP, respectively. Additionally, a Western blot for NF-κB inhibitor α (IκBα) was performed to measure Manuka honey’s effect on the NF-κB pathway via IκBα phosphorylation. The results indicate a cytotoxic limit of 3-5% v/v. The presence of 1% honey decreased superoxide release at 24 hours. The 0.5, 1, and 3% honey concentrations reduced chemotaxis and IκBα phosphorylation in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that Manuka honey significantly reduces neutrophil recruitment and inflammatory behavior in the wound site in a dose-dependent fashion under the cytotoxic limit.</i><br><strong>Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/6132581\">Source</a><br><strong>Citations:</strong> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a> <a href=\"#fnref1:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a> <a href=\"#fnref1:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a> <a href=\"#fnref1:3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a> <a href=\"#fnref1:4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p><strong>Study Type:</strong> Animal Study: In Vitro<br><strong>Title:</strong> Intravenous Administration of Manuka Honey Inhibits Tumor Growth and Improves Host Survival When Used in Combination with Chemotherapy in a Melanoma Mouse Model<br><strong>Author(s):</strong> Maria J.

In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative activity of manuka honey on three different cancer cell lines, murine melanoma (B16.F1) and colorectal carcinoma (CT26) as well as human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells in vitro. The data demonstrate that manuka honey has potent anti-proliferative effect on all three cancer cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner, being effective at concentrations as low as 0.6% (w/v). This effect is mediated via the activation of a caspase 9-dependent apoptotic pathway, leading to the induction of caspase 3, reduced Bcl-2 expression, DNA fragmentation and cell death. Combination treatment of cancer cells with manuka and paclitaxel in vitro, however, revealed no evidence of a synergistic action on cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we utilized an in vivo syngeneic mouse melanoma model to assess the potential effect of intravenously-administered manuka honey, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, on the growth of established tumors. Our findings indicate that systemic administration of manuka honey was not associated with any alterations in haematological or clinical chemistry values in serum of treated mice, demonstrating its safety profile. Treatment with manuka honey alone resulted in about 33% inhibition of tumor growth, which correlated with histologically observable increase in tumor apoptosis. Although better control of tumor growth was observed in animals treated with paclitaxel alone or in combination with manuka honey (61% inhibition), a dramatic improvement in host survival was seen in the co-treatment group. This highlights a potentially novel role for manuka honey in alleviating chemotherapy-induced toxicity.</i><br><strong>Link:</strong> <a

It is also known as a “superfood” that is solely consumed by the queen bee. Royal jelly is also fed to the honeybee larvae upon hatching and helps to nurture the brood. It is the exclusive nutriment offered to the immature young larvae in their first 2-3 days of maturation besides being used as a food specifically for the queen bee throughout her entire life cycle. Royalactin is the main compound in royal jelly that allows the morphological change of a larva into the queen bee. This superfood is the main reason for the longevity of the queen bee compared to the other bees. Royal jelly is widely used as a dietary nutritional complex to help combat various chronic health conditions. Furthermore, it is one of the profitable remedies for human beings in both traditional and modern medicine. Many pharmacological activities such as antibacterial, antitumor, antiallergy, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects have also been attributed to it.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<h2 id=\"Composition\">Composition</h2>\n<h2 id=\"Healing-Properties\">Healing Properties</h2>\n<h2 id=\"Disease-Symptom-Treatment\">Disease / Symptom Treatment</h2>\n<h2 id=\"Adverse-Affects\">Adverse Affects</h2>\n<h2 id=\"Synergistic-Effects\">Synergistic Effects</h2>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p><strong>Title:</strong> <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1155%2F2017%2F1259510\">Honey, Propolis, and Royal Jelly: A Comprehensive Review of Their Biological Actions and Health Benefits</a><br>\n<strong>Publication:</strong> <a href=\"\">Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</a><br>\n<strong>Date:</strong> July 2017<br>\n<strong>Study Type:</strong> Comprehensive Review<br>\n<strong>Author(s):</strong> Visweswara Rao Pasupuleti, Lakhsmi Sammugam, Nagesvari Ramesh, and Siew Hua Gan<br>\n<strong>Institutions:</strong> Universiti Malaysia Kelantan, Jeli, Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia<br>\n<strong>Copy:</strong> <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/\">archive</a>, <a href=\"https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/\">archive-mirror</a> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n"},{"title":"Tualang Honey","_content":"**Tualang Honey** is a multifloral jungle honey found in Malaysia.[^1] Tualang Honey is produced by the rock bee (Apis dorsata), which builds hives high up in the branches of Tualang tree (Kompassia excelsa).[^1] The Tualang tree (common name Mengaris) can reach up to 250 feet in height. The honeycombs can be up to 6 feet across, and the hive can contain as many as 30,000 bees.[^1] More than 100 nests may be found on one Tualang tree.
